Unconstrained optimization problems in deep learning
Our task focuses on handling image classification problems (SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100) by applying standard deep neural networks like ResNet-18 and VGG-16. The optimization procedure is searching optimum model parameter vector via a given loss function by dominant first-order optimizers in the field of deep learning including SGD, NoisySGD, Adam, and AdamW.
